==========

An extensible Android app for people with communication difficulties.

It's written in Love for android (http://www.love2d.org).

The idea is that the caretakers of the person with communication difficulties can customize the complexity level of the communication.

Each folder within the "words" folder can contain .ogg and .png pairs which is a sound that will be played when the image is pressed.
